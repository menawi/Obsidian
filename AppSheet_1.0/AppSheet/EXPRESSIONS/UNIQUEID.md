### Basic Form

```javascript

UNIQUEID()


```

`UNIQUEID()` (with no argument) generates a sequence of *8* random digits and letters suitable for use as a unique identifier within the app, such as a row key.  
  
⚠️ The generated ID is not strictly unique. 

Instead, it is sufficiently random as to be effectively unique for all practical uses within the app. The chance of a duplicate ID being generated is virtually zero.
