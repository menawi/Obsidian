## Introduction

> These are observations are lessons I took from my time learning how to use Google AppSheets. It may seem like an intuitive program to use, but it required a lot of learning to be able to use it coherently.

### Database vs. App paradigm shift

> Although there is  a database option, app sheets is designed to produce apps; all the options for automation and other functionality are present only in the app editor and not in the database editor.

### Expressions 
[[Expressions Guide]]

> Expressions really changed the game for me ➡️ bit of a learning curve but it is fun to understand how to #relate data in #meaningful ways
> 
> An aspect of it that becomes immediately clear is the #Query theme of all programming languages : identify, assign and manipulate data in #meaningful ways.
> 
> Answer questions using data.

### Automation 
[[JSON PARSING BUG (solved)]]

> Wrote my first functional script today that calculates reduction in stock count based on orders. 
The syntax and the sematics were both challenging ➡️  _Had to be extremely precise and match word for word in my App, not based on the names he used in his app_ 

##### الحمدلله it was a successful venture though.
